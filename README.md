Homework Week 5 - Trivia Game

This assignment utilized different elements of jQuery and Javascript to create a timed true or false quiz.  The user is given twenty
seconds to answer a five question quiz.  Upon answering the last question or running the allotted time limit, the results screen is
then displayed, showing the users final score.

This assignment took me a while to figure out.  Ultimately I had to refer to some online tutorials on the subject to help guide me through
the process.  In addition to my busy schedule and my own struggle to actually complete the assignment, it is only at this time that I was
confident enough with its state to push through to GitHub.  My apologies for the tardiness.
